I recently settled into a new apartment after a grueling two month search, so I
thought I'd share some of my experience looking for an apartment during the
[worst time of the year for it][lifehacker]. It can be a harrowing time, and to
be honest, if you can put it off until a better time of year, I'd recommend it.
Prices will be lower and the competition for the affordable places will be
considerably less fierce.  Regardless of when you're on the hunt, though, here
are some tips that might help you get through it a little easier. READMORE What
I share here is from the perspective of looking for a place to myself, but
**much of it should still apply if you're looking for a roommate situation**.

## Know What You Want

When I started looking for a new place to live, it was easy to start
rationalizing every place I went into and think "I could make this work". I
would spend my time applying and put in the application fee, and then a couple
hours later realize that I didn't really want it. Something that helped me to
make a decision on a place before wasting too much time and money was to have a
set of clear criteria that I could go over. My rule of thumb was that it had to
meet all but one criteria, and some were more negotiable than others.

My criteria:

- Bathtub
- Not on the ground floor
- Not in a sketchy area where I wouldn't feel safe myself, or having my
  girlfriend walk
- Room for all of my stuff and space to stretch out in between
- Wood floors
- Under $2000 ($2200 max fail)
- Close to work, and the Mission

In this case I ended up compromising on the wood floors. To state the obvious,
**the higher you go on price, the less competition you'll have**, and better
odds of satisfying all of your criteria. $2000 was actually kind of on the low
end for my criteria, though I eventually found a place for a little less than
that.

## Be on the Ground

Most landlords won't even consider you unless they can see your face. If you're
coming in from out of town, you're going to have a much harder time finding a
place unless you find your way to the city first. Expect to pay higher rent and
get a lot more rejections. Landlords are on the watch for scammers, too, and
for better or worse, one clear warning sign of a scam is that the person is out
of town. Your best bet is to find some temporary accommodations in the city and
look from there.

## Papers, please!

When you go to a showing, typically they will have applications you can fill
out, but it can become really tiring and discouraging to spend fifteen minutes
apiece filling out one application after another. The [California Apartment
Association][caanet] has an application that is pretty generally accepted. You
can fill it out by hand and scan/copy it, or fill it out with a tool like
[Adobe Acrobat][acrobat] or [Xournal][xournal]. Aside from the application,
different landlords and leasing agents will expect to see different documents.
Here's a list of documents I'd recommend keeping with you in a folder:

<input type='checkbox'>
3 filled out copies of an application
</input>
<br />
<input type='checkbox'>
2 photocopies of your drivers license or other state ID
</input>
<br />
<input type='checkbox'>
1 copy of your full credit report (yes, there is the occasional landlord who
wants the full 30+ page report)
</input>
<br />
<input type='checkbox'>
2 copies of your printed credit score (nothing fancy, just your name and a
number from one of the three credit bureaus)
</input>
<br />
<input type='checkbox'>
checkbook (you're unlikely to need to put down a deposit, but some require a
rental application fee of around $50)
</input>
<br />
<input type='checkbox'>
2 copies of a reference letter from your previous landlord (you can find a form
letter online to send to your landlord and ask them to sign)
</input>
<br />
<input type='checkbox'>
2 copies of your most recent 3 pay stubs
</input>

## The Hunt

Here's where the rubber hits the road. Before we get started, I want to give
you a little personal advice: **don't get attached**. We all like to think
we're that one delicate and unique flower in the field that is somehow more
precious than all the others, but keep in mind that there are probably a lot of
qualified candidates applying for each of the units you're visiting, some of
whom have better credit scores. Like sales, apartment hunting is a numbers
game. The more places you apply to (that meet your criteria, of course), the
better your chances of getting something you like.

#### Padmapper

[Padmapper][padmapper] was my power tool of choice during this hunt. In the
past I always just used craigslist search and RSS feeds, but Padmapper makes it
so much easier to find craigslist results in the areas that I want to live in
and quickly filter them out.  I'd recommend signing up for an account and
setting up an email alert. My workflow went something like this:

1. open Padmapper
2. click open a link into a new tab
3. respond to the ad by their preferred means if I'm interested (or take a note
  to do so later)
4. close the tab
5. hide the result in Padmapper
6. repeat

And come back in another hour or two to start the process again...

*Side note*: I'd occasionally get gateway errors with Padmapper, so if you run
into that you can clear your cookies and log back in. In Chrome you can click
on the icon to the left of the url and click on "Show cookies and site data",
and remove them from there.

#### Responding

It's important to respond to ads promptly, because often times the poster ends
up inundated with responses and won't be as likely to reply after the first few
hours or so. You should still respond if you're interested regardless, but your
odds are better the earlier you do.

Some ads will want you to email, others call, and still others just want you to
show up at the open house. If they have something marked as a preferred contact
means under the "reply" menu, make sure to use that.

You can make responding less painful having a simple canned email that you can
modify for each listing. Gmail has a Labs feature called Canned Responses that
you can enable. In your email you should have:

- the address you're interested in
- anything specifically asked for in the posting
- 3-4 sentences about you
- how to contact you
- I also like to paste in the craigslist link at the bottom for easy access

Here's the message that I used:

<blockquote>
RE: Elegant Studio - With full amenities
<br />
<br />
Hi there,
<br />
<br />
I saw your ad on Craigslist for a studio at Harrison at Main and the apartment
sounds like a good fit for me. I'd love to come check it out if it's still
available. When works best for you?
<br />
<br />
About me, if you're interested: I'm 33 years old and I work for a company that
helps schools to minimize administrative costs, in particular by reducing
paperwork. Sounds kind of boring, but it's having a huge impact. I bike a ton,
climb some, and try to get outside and wander when I get a chance. I'm pretty
quiet and clean, don't smoke or use drugs, and don't have any pets.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, so please let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know about
me. If it's more convenient, you can call me at ^^^-^^^-^^^^.
<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you,
<br />
<br />
- Robert
</blockquote>

This will differ pretty dramatically if you're looking for a roommate
situation, since then it is much more important to express your personality and
respond to the specifics of their posting. You can still have a canned email,
but you'll need to customize it a bit more.

#### Showing Up

Most people will suggest that you show up early for a listing. This is, in my
experience, only true-ish. It depends on a lot of factors, and I would still
recommend it for the most part, but it can depend on the situation. Some places
go first-come, first-serve, many are looking for a pile of decent applications
to choose from, and some are actually looking for a personality fit. For the
most part I've found that showing up 15 minutes or so before the viewing can be
helpful, since the person showing it is often there early, too, and you can
sneak in before anybody else shows up. Other times you're one of a mass of
people who got the same idea, so your mileage may vary.

Be aware that **landlords aren't your friends**. Schmoozing can be productive,
but their top priorities are going to be looking for someone who is clean,
quiet, and pays their bills on time. Those are the traits that you should focus
on exhibiting, with likeability in a close fourth. Often times the person
showing the apartment isn't going to be the decision maker anyway, and your
application will have to speak for itself.

#### Anatomy of a Scam
Whenever there are goods and services being exchanged for money, there will be
people trying to scam both sides, and here is no exception. On the property
side, scammers will often pose as potential renters who for one reason or
another can't come to see the property. Typically, they are after the bank
account info of the landlord with the overt intention of transferring a deposit
into it, and the subvert intention of draining it.

From the other side of things, scammers will try to get you to pay them without
having any goods to deliver. They will list an apartment that is not on the
market and give you excuses why you can't see it. Either the tenant is out of
town, or they already have a ton of applications and want you to get your
chance, or it's under renovation. They might tell you to drive by it and check
it out from the outside. They'll ask you to pay up front and emphasize that
time is of the essence, and possibly try to tell you they think you're the
right person for the place, despite knowing nothing about you. A corollary to
the bit above about landlords not being your friend is that if they sound like
you're friend, they're almost certainly a scammer. Some even go so far as to
offer you deals if you pay more up front, such as 10% discount for 6-months
rent up front and 15% for a year.

Bottom line is, **if it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is**.
Scammers will do what they can to try to look legitimate. They will copy images
and descriptions from other postings and websites. They might impersonate a
real person, using "brian.smith@yahoo.com" when there is a real
"brian.smith@somerealtyco.com". They might even be so bold as to copy
a listing with an open house that is still available. You go to the open house,
like it, and then pay the scammer instead of the real owner. When in doubt,
make sure you see the face of the person you're in touch with.

## Additional Thoughts

There's still a lot I could add to this, but I think I've shared the most
important parts. A couple of final bits of advice, though.

First off, iterate. I spent a little time every day looking over my application
and the process I was using, and it was surprising to find there was always
something that could use a bit more tuning, whether it be on my application or
my presentation. I even went so far as to get my shaggy hair trimmed up a bit
to look more presentable.

A second thought is to ask for feedback. People showing apartments are going to
be pretty busy and overwhelmed, but there might be a window from time to time
where you can ask them what they're looking for and if there are any red flags
on your application.
